# Options-Trader-Website
A website made with Flask and javascript.
It uses yfinance to get the stock data, which is not the best for fast operations, but this project is not intended for production which is why it uses it.
The website is running on https://mikematar.pythonanywhere.com/
It doesn't have a good design as I focused on its backend, but I will focus on giving it a proffessional look when I finish the backend tasks.
